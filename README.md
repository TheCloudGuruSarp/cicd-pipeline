## Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline implements a sophisticated workflow architecture with distinct stages and conditional execution paths:

1. **Initialization**: Environment preparation, cache restoration, and dependency resolution
2. **Code Quality**: Static analysis, linting, and code style enforcement
3. **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency vulnerability scanning, and license compliance checks
4. **Build Process**: Compilation, artifact generation, and container image creation
5. **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage analysis
6. **Artifact Publication**: Version tagging, signing, and publishing to registries
7. **Deployment Preparation**: Configuration validation and environment-specific customization
8. **Progressive Deployment**: Controlled rollout across development, staging, and production
9. **Verification**: Post-deployment testing and health checks
10. **Observability**: Metrics collection, log aggregation, and performance analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with appropriate repository permissions
- Docker Engine (20.10+) and Docker Compose (2.0+) for local development
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20+) with proper RBAC configuration for deployments
- AWS account with programmatic access for infrastructure provisioning
- Node.js (16.x+) and npm (8.x+) for application development
- Terraform (1.0+) for infrastructure management
- kubectl CLI configured to access your Kubernetes clusters

### Initial Setup

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account or organization
2. Clone the repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cicd-pipeline.git`
3. Install dependencies: `cd cicd-pipeline && npm install`
4. Configure the required GitHub repository secrets:

   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY             # AWS secret key for infrastructure provisioning
   DOCKER_USERNAME                   # Docker Hub or container registry username
   DOCKER_PASSWORD                   # Docker Hub or container registry password/token
