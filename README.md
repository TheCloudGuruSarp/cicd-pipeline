# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a containerized microservice application.

## ✨ Developed by Sarper ✨

---



## Features

- Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
- Multi-environment deployment strategy (dev, staging, production)
- Container image building and scanning
- Infrastructure as Code validation
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Deployment to Kubernetes cluster
- Slack notifications for pipeline events

## Pipeline Workflow

The pipeline workflow consists of several stages: code validation, building, testing, security scanning, and deployment across multiple environments (development, staging, and production).
