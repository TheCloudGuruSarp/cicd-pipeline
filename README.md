## Features

- Fully automated build, test, and deployment pipeline with comprehensive audit trails
- Progressive delivery strategy across multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- Optimized container image building with layer caching and multi-stage builds
- Advanced security scanning for vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and container images
- Infrastructure as Code validation with policy enforcement and drift detection
- Comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Automated quality gates with code coverage and static analysis metrics
- GitOps-based deployment to Kubernetes clusters with canary and blue-green capabilities
- Integrated observability with detailed pipeline metrics and performance analytics
- Intelligent notification system with contextual alerts to Slack and email

## Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline implements a sophisticated workflow architecture with distinct stages and conditional execution paths:

1. **Initialization**: Environment preparation, cache restoration, and dependency resolution
2. **Code Quality**: Static analysis, linting, and code style enforcement
3. **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency vulnerability scanning, and license compliance checks
4. **Build Process**: Compilation, artifact generation, and container image creation
5. **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and code coverage analysis
6. **Artifact Publication**: Version tagging, signing, and publishing to registries
7. **Deployment Preparation**: Configuration validation and environment-specific customization
8. **Progressive Deployment**: Controlled rollout across development, staging, and production
9. **Verification**: Post-deployment testing and health checks
10. **Observability**: Metrics collection, log aggregation, and performance analysis

   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID                 # AWS access key for infrastructure provisioning
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY             # AWS secret key for infrastructure provisioning
   DOCKER_USERNAME                   # Docker Hub or container registry username
   DOCKER_PASSWORD                   # Docker Hub or container registry password/token
   
   # Deployment configuration
   KUBE_CONFIG_DATA                  # Base64-encoded kubeconfig file for Kubernetes access
   KUBE_NAMESPACE                    # Target Kubernetes namespace for deployments
   
   # Notification and monitoring
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL                 # Slack webhook for notifications
   DATADOG_API_KEY                   # Datadog API key for metrics (optional)
   
   # Security scanning
